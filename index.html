            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>Hey ! Are you free? Cause you are here!üòä Hehey, okay then I have a short story for you. Here it goes‚Ä¶</p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>Once there was a teddy bear named Coco. Coco recently got admission in a new high school. The new academic session started of the high school. Everyone came from different previous schools and different places. All the teddy bears were so excited to make new friends, explore new fields, go to new places. Soon, many friends groups were formed. </p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>Coco also had a cute friend circle. Many other teddy bears like Piku, Reesh, Aaro and many more were in his group. But gradually the teddy circle became a big one of around 13-15 teddy bears. Everyone was happy and enjoying their high school at fullest from skipping the mess breakfast to planning the evening ice-cream party. They already decided so many trips to teddy point, lakes and decided trips in earlier.</p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>After some time, high school exams were there. Everyone was preparing for it. Everyone wanted notes and all. Coco‚Äôs group decided that they will grow together and share the notes everyone had so that everyone can get benefit from it. Coco was happy that she had a so nice and healthy friend circle. But who said it will exist the entire high school period.</p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>Slowly it felt that the friend circle of Coco had some hints of cracks. In such a big group, small small sub groups were getting formed who matched their each other vibe. Coco could easily feel that and may be other teddy also. </p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>Again there was a season of exams, this time nobody actually shared notes to help each other. Only internal sub groups were helping each other. Results also came out soon. In their friend circle, Piku got the highest grade but only Coco and Aaro were happy for him and rest all were jealous. At that time, Coco realised that many of them whom she believed, were just fake friends.</p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>And then finally, the big group broke. Coco didn‚Äôt expected that teddys actually left when they promised to be together till end. Coco was sad and realised that it was very easy for other teddy to just leave someone in between and use them but it was not easy for Coco to accept it so easily. </p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>Piku talked to her and said ‚ÄúHey Coco! Don‚Äôt be sad bro. Why you get always so much emotionally attached to someone so early ? I already knew this thing that this would happen one day. Don‚Äôt worry. Me and Aaro will be always with you little idiot. Now smile.‚Äù Coco laughed and said ‚ÄúStop you idiot! I am not little!.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will be always little. Hehehy!, right Aaro?.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah Piku, obviously.‚Äù The trio went for a honey waffle party. </p></div>
            <div class="swiper-slide"><p>The things ended with a sad and happy ending.‚ù§Ô∏è</p></div>
